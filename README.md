# GraphRAG notebooks

Tried both `pg_advanced.ipynb` and `llama_index_neo4j_custom_retriever.ipynb` but they didn't work.

Going to try `graphrag_v2.ipynb` next.

Run `cp .env.example .env` and configure environment variables.

Finally, run the following command to start the Docker services:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
